# FORMULIS

Formulis is a dynamic and intelligent form-based interface to create RDF data. It allows you the create interconnected resources by presenting the interface as nest forms, thus converting the RDF graph-based data into a tree-based interface made of forms.
Formulis uses SEWELIS mechanisms to suggest values from the database while taking into account the fields already filled.

FORMULIS was developped by Pierre Maillot from the SemLIS team, IRISA, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France (https://www-semlis.irisa.fr/) in the effort to make data more accessible to users.
This work was partially supported by ANR project IDFRAud (ANR-14-CE28-0012)
